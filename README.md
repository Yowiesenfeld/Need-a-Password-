As a teen and now student I spent majority of my day on my phone and computer. 
Which also means that i have to have many diffrent passwords and its kinda difficult to think of so many random ones epcially on the spot. So this week ! created a webpage for you that will help generate random passwords. 
While I was completing this assignment I learned  lot about problem solving and debugging. 
I did end up finishing it in one day which was why theres not many commits... hope you find this as helpful as I have! THank you! 

Password Generator Starter Code
GIVEN I need a new, secure password
WHEN I click the button to generate a password
THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria
WHEN prompted for password criteria
THEN I select which criteria to include in the password
WHEN prompted for the length of the password
THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters
WHEN asked for character types to include in the password
THEN I confirm whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
WHEN I answer each prompt
THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected
WHEN all prompts are answered
THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria
WHEN the password is generated
THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page
